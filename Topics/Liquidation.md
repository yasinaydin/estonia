From [1], info:
- The submission of these documents is followed by liquidation which takes a minimum of (6) months. 
- Detailed information about the full process can be found in the State Portal[2]
- After your OÜ has been liquidated, the company management board will have to submit an application to the Commercial Register for the deletion of the company from the Commercial Register. All applications can be submitted digitally with (active) e-Residency digital ID cards.
- In general, the whole process typically takes (8) months. For the board members, this is a passive period though as the process itself is rather straightforward and doesn’t require significant effort from founders side when a business service provider is used for assistance.
